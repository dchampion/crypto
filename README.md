# crypto
This repository contains notes and research on the subject of cryptography, a high-level summary of which is presented in this ~12k-word <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>survey of <i>public-key</i> cryptography</a>; a relatively modern branch of the field that is (among other things) foundational to internet security.
<p>
If the mere thought of <i>12k-word survey</i> makes your eyes glaze over, read only the first page, which recounts a little-known and entertaining anecdote from the early days of academic cryptography.
<p>
Each artifact in this repository&mdash;excluding <i>meta</i> files like this README&mdash;is summarized below.

## List of Substantive Artifacts (alphabetical)
<p>
1. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/CryptoNotes.txt><b>CryptoNotes.txt</b></a> &ndash; A collection of sundry notes&mdash;including open questions, and some answers&mdash;gathered during the course of my research.
<p>
2. <b>Cryptography.xlsx</b> &ndash; A collection of <i>MS-Excel</i> worksheets used to facilitate my understanding of various cryptographic techniques.
<p>
3. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/EuclideanAlgorithms.md><b>EuclideanAlgorithms.md</b></a> &ndash; A demonstration of the Euclidean algorithms, which can be used to efficiently compute encryption and decryption exponents used in RSA encryption.
<p>
4. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/LectureNotes.txt><b>LectureNotes.txt</b></a> &ndash; Lecture notes from a two-semester course on cryptography I took online in the winter and spring of 2020/2021.
<p>
5. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/NumberTheory.md><b>NumberTheory.md</b></a> &ndash; Helpful mnemonics on the number-theoretic underpinnings of Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
<p>
6. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/src><b>Source Code</b></a> &ndash; Implementations of many of the cryptographic primitives covered in these documents in the Python programming language; e.g. the Euclidean algorithms, primality testing, Diffie-Hellman, RSA, etc.
<p>
7. <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf><b>TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf</b></a> &ndash; A 12k-word survey of public-key cryptography.
