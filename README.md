## <i>What I did during the pandemic</i>
This repository contains findings and notes gathered over a period of roughly 12 months beginning in March 2020; let's call it  the <i>Pandemic Year</i>. It culminates in a 12k-word <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/723b6b5a89dfb35c9d5806d381fe8cec55eacfd9/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>survey on <i>public-key</i> cryptography</a>; a (relatively) modern branch of the field that is (among other things) foundational to internet security.
<p>
If the mere sight of the phrase <i>12k-word survey</i> makes your eyes glaze over, read just the first page, which contains an entertaining, though little-known, historical anecdote.

A description of each artifact in this repository&mdash;excluding <i>meta</i> files, such as this one&mdash;is enumerated at the end of this <code>README</code>.

## <i>Why did I do this?</i>
<b>Short answer:</b> I was bored.
<p>
<b>Long answer:</b> When I was a kid I was fascinated by magic; as in the sleight-of-hand, illusion, <i>abracadabra</i>, senses of the word. I am attracted to cryptography for the same reasons. As Arthur C. Clarke once said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
<p>
<b>Longer answer:</b> My interest was piqued in 2016, when as a software engineer I was tasked by my former employer with securing communications between microservices to ready them for migration to a public cloud environment. Coincidentally, at around the same time I developed a passing interest in cryptocurrency&mdash;<i>Bitcoin</i>, in particular&mdash;which has continued to this day. My research on these subjects invariably led to more questions, which my restless brain cannot seem to let go unanswered.
