## <i>What did I do during the pandemic?</i>
This repository contains findings and notes gathered over a period of roughly 12 months beginning in March 2020; let's call this the <i>Pandemic Year</i>. It culminates in a 12k-word <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>survey of <i>public-key</i> cryptography</a>; a (relatively) modern branch of the field that is (among other things) foundational to internet security.
<p>
If the mere sight of the phrase <i>12k-word survey</i> makes your eyes glaze over, read just the first page, which recounts a little-known and entertaining anecdote from the early days of academic cryptography.
<p>
Each artifact in this repository&mdash;excluding <i>meta</i> files like this README&mdash;is enumerated with a short description at the end of this document.

## <i>Why did I do this?</i>
<b>Short answer:</b> I was bored.
<p>
<b>Long answer:</b> When I was a kid I was fascinated by magic; in the sleight-of-hand, illusion and <i>abracadabra</i> senses of the word. I am attracted to cryptography for the same reasons. As Arthur C. Clarke once said, "<i>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</i>"
