## <i>What did I do during the pandemic?</i>
This repository contains notes, research and other artifacts concerning cryptography that I started curating in March 2020, and that I continue to revise and maintain. It culminates in a ~12k-word <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>survey of <i>public-key</i> cryptography</a>; a relatively modern branch of the field that is&mdash;among other things&mdash;foundational to internet security.
<p>
If the mere thought of <i>12k-word survey</i> makes your eyes glaze over, read only the first page, which recounts a little-known and entertaining anecdote from the early days of academic cryptography.
<p>
Each artifact in this repository&mdash;excluding <i>meta</i> files like this README&mdash;is enumerated with a short description below.

## <i>Why did I do this?</i>
<b>Short answer:</b> I was bored.
<p>
<b>Long answer:</b> When I was a kid I was fascinated by magic. The same fascination attracts me to the profound elegance of modern cryptography. As Arthur C. Clarke once said, "<i>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</i>"
