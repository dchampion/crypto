## <i>What did I do during the pandemic?</i>
This repository contains artifacts that I created, and that I continue to maintain and revise, starting in March 2020. It culminates in a 12k-word <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>survey of <i>public-key</i> cryptography</a>; a (relatively) modern branch of the field that is (among other things) foundational to internet security.
<p>
If the mere sight of the phrase <i>12k-word survey</i> makes your eyes glaze over, read just the first page, which recounts a little-known and entertaining anecdote from the early days of academic cryptography.
<p>
Each artifact in this repository&mdash;excluding <i>meta</i> files like this README&mdash;is enumerated with a short description below.

## <i>Why did I do this?</i>
<b>Short answer:</b> I was bored.
<p>
<b>Long answer:</b> When I was a kid I was fascinated by magic. The same fascination attracts me to the profound elegance of cryptography. As Arthur C. Clarke once said, "<i>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</i>"

## List of Substantive Artifacts (alphabetical)
<p>
1. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/CryptoNotes.txt><b>CryptoNotes.txt</b></a> &ndash; A collection of sundry notes&mdash;including previously-open questions, and their answers&mdash;gathered during the course of my research.
<p>
2. <b>Cryptography.xlxs</b> &ndash; A collection of <i>MS-Excel</i> worksheets I used to facilitate my understanding of various cryptographic techniques.
<p>
3. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/EuclideanAlgorithms.md><b>EuclideanAlgorithms.md</b></a> &ndash; A demonstration of the use of the Euclidean Algorithms (simple and extended) to compute the encryption and decryption exponents used in the example of RSA encryption I present in the <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>PDF</a>.
<p>
4. <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/LectureNotes.txt><b>LectureNotes.txt</b></a> &ndash; Lecture notes from a two-semester, college-level survey course on cryptography taken online.
