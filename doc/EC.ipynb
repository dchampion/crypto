    "## A Demonstration of the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC)\n",
    "The elliptic curve cryptosystem demonstrated below combines [Diffie&ndash;Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) style symmetric key agreement with a digital signature to provide for the _confidentiality_, _integrity_ and _authenticy_ of a message exchanged between two parties (Alice and Bob) over an insecure channel. A third party (Eve) listening on this channel has no practical way of learning the content of the message, nor any way of tampering with it without the receiving party knowing the message has been corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key&ndash;agreement component of this cryptosystem provides for message confidentiality, and is known by the initials _ECDH_, which is short for [_Elliptic&ndash;Curve Diffie&ndash;Hellman_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman). The digital signature component of this cryptosystem provides for message integrity and authenticity, and is known by the initials _ECDSA_, for [_Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic curve cryptography represents a novel approach to the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (DLP) introduced by Diffie and Hellman in their 1976 paper [_New Directions in Cryptography_](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). The Diffie&ndash;Hellman protocol remains to this day the basis for key agreement over insecure channels. Elliptic&ndash;curve DLP has the advantage of requiring much shorter key lengths than traditional DH, however, to achieve equivalent security levels. This makes ECC the only practical choice in size&ndash; and/or power&ndash;constrained applications, such as contactless smartcards and smart phones. Whereas an ECC key of 256 bits in length provides 128&ndash;bit security (today considered the minimum acceptible security level), DH and [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) keys must be at least 3,072 bits in length to provide the same level of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Caveat\n",
    "Note that the procedure as demonstrated provides no guarantee as to the authenticity of either party; that is, that the participants Alice or Bob (or both) are who they claim to be (see [_man&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;middle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attack for elaboration). Nor does it guarantee that the message encrypted in the procedure cannot be decrypted by an adversary if either private key used in the procedure is compromised at a future date (see [_forward secrecy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) for elaboration). Protections against either vulnerability are not precluded by this implementation, but they are omitted here to minimize conceptual clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Procedure\n",
    "The following procedure, which utilizes the services of this repository's [ec](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/ec.py) module, illustrates a session in which Alice signs and encrypts a private message, and then transmits this message, together with the signature, to Bob over an insecure channel. Meanwhile, an adversary (Eve) intecepts the message&ndash;signature pair transmitted on the insecure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the [ec](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/ec.py) module; but that only Alice and Bob possess the signing and encryption keys generated by this module to provide the aforementioned protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob start by importing the modules [curves](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/curves.py) and [ec](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/ec.py), and a module [sym](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/tests/core/sym.py) that implements a symmetric cipher they have agreed in advance will be used to encrypt and decrypt messages (the [sym](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/tests/core/sym.py) cipher used here is for illustrative purposes only, and in a real&ndash;world setting would be replaced with a cryptographically&ndash;strong symmetric cipher such as _3DES_ or _AES_)."
