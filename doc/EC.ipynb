    "## A Demonstration of the Elliptic Curve (EC) Cryptosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The EC cryptosystem demonstrated below combines Diffie&ndash;Hellman style symmetric key agreement with a digital signature to provide confidentiality, integrity and authentication in a message&ndash;exchange between two parties (Alice and Bob) over an insecure channel. A third party (Eve) eavesdropping on this channel has no practical way of learning the content of the message, nor any way of corrupting it without the receiving party knowing the message has been corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key&ndash;agreement component of this cryptosystem provides for message confidentiality, and is known by the initials *ECDH*, which is short for *Elliptic Curve Diffie&ndash;Hellman* (alternatively *ECDHE*, the last *E* standing for *Ephemeral*, to indicate that the session key negotiated by the message&ndash;exchanging parties is to be used only once and then discarded). The digital signature component of this cryptosystem provides for message integrity and authenticity, and is known by the initials *ECDSA*, for *Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic curve cryptography represents a novel approach to the *discrete logarithm problem* (DLP) introduced by Diffie and Hellman in their 1976 paper [*New Directions in Cryptography*](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). The Diffie&ndash;Hellman protocol remains to this day the basis for key agreement over insecure channels. Elliptic&ndash;curve DLP has the advantage of requiring much shorter key lengths than traditional DH, however, to achieve equivalent security levels. This makes EC the only practical choice in size&ndash; and/or power&ndash;constrained applications, such as contactless smartcards and smart phones. Whereas an EC key of 256 bits in length provides 128&ndash;bit security (today considered the minimum acceptible security level), DH and RSA keys must be at least 3,072 bits long to provide the same level of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Source Code\n",
    "The following sequence of function calls to the `ec` module (located in the [/src](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/code/src) directory of this repository) illustrates a session in which Alice signs and encrypts a private message, and then transmits the message, together with the signature, to Bob over an insecure channel. Meanwhile, an adversary&mdash;Eve&mdash;intercepts the message&ndash;signature pair transmitted on the insecure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the `ec` module; but that only Alice and Bob possess the signing and encryption keys generated by this module to provide the aforementioned protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values below surrounded in square brackets [ ] are public (i.e., they can be transmitted over the insecure channel with no compromise to the security of the system, even if they are observed by Eve), and those that are not in square brackets are private (i.e., they must not be transmitted over the insecure channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanations of behavior appear *below* the code snippets and their outputs."
