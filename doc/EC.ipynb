    "## A Demonstration of the Elliptic Curve (EC) Cryptosystem\n",
    "The elliptic curve cryptosystem demonstrated below combines [Diffie&ndash;Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) style symmetric key agreement with a digital signature to provide for the confidentiality, integrity and authenticy of a message exchanged between two parties (Alice and Bob) over an insecure channel. A third party (Eve), listening on this channel, has no practical way of learning the content of the message, nor any way of tampering with it without the receiving party knowing the message has been corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key&ndash;agreement component of this cryptosystem provides for message confidentiality, and is known by the initials *ECDH*, which is short for [*Elliptic&ndash;Curve Diffie&ndash;Hellman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) (alternatively *ECDHE*, the last *E* standing for *Ephemeral*, to indicate that the session key negotiated by the message&ndash;exchanging parties is to be used only once and then discarded). The digital signature component of this cryptosystem provides for message integrity and authenticity, and is known by the initials *ECDSA*, for [*Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic curve cryptography represents a novel approach to the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (DLP) introduced by Diffie and Hellman in their 1976 paper [*New Directions in Cryptography*](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). The Diffie&ndash;Hellman protocol remains to this day the basis for key agreement over insecure channels. Elliptic&ndash;curve DLP has the advantage of requiring much shorter key lengths than traditional DH, however, to achieve equivalent security levels. This makes EC the only practical choice in size&ndash; and/or power&ndash;constrained applications, such as contactless smartcards and smart phones. Whereas an EC key of 256 bits in length provides 128&ndash;bit security (today considered the minimum acceptible security level), DH and [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) keys must be at least 3,072 bits in length to provide the same level of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Source Code\n",
    "The following sequence of function calls to the [ec](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/ec.py) module illustrates a session in which Alice signs and encrypts a private message, and then transmits this message, together with the signature, to Bob over an insecure channel. Meanwhile, an adversary (Eve) intecepts the message&ndash;signature pair transmitted on the insecure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the [ec](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/ec.py) module; but that only Alice and Bob possess the signing and encryption keys generated by this module to provide the aforementioned protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of each code snippet is a line&ndash;comment to indicate who (i.e., Alice, Bob and/or Eve) is invoking the code. Illustrative code snippets, i.e., those that are not part of the protocol, but rather merely informative, are not commented."
