    "# A Demonstration of the Diffie&ndash;Hellman Key Agreement Protocol\n",
    "The Diffie&ndash;Hellman protocol presented below demonstrates a confidential message exchange between two parties&mdash;Alice and Bob&mdash;over an insecure channel. Further, a third party&mdash;Eve&mdash;who intercepts the message encrypted using this protocol, has no feasible way of learning its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie and Hellman first introduced this protocol in 1976, in their seminal paper [*New Directions in Cryptography*](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). In it, the authors imagined a novel cryptosystem in which a publicly&ndash;known key could be used to encrypt a message that only the holder of a private key could decrypt, thereby solving a problem that bedeviled all previously known ciphers; that of exchanging encryption keys *securely* between trusted parties. Such a *public&ndash;key* cryptosystem could further be employed to guarantee message authenticity (a property that encryption alone could not), via a process they called *digital signature*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Diffie and Hellman fell short of presenting a practical implementation for such a cryptosystem, they laid the critical groundwork for it (it would fall to Rivest, Shamir and Adlemen to flesh it out in their 1978 paper [*A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public&ndash;Key Cryptosystems*](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie and Hellman did, however, leave us with a very important, practical contribution; a protocol for secure key&ndash;exchange that remains to this day the de facto method of exchanging keys over insecure channels. The method is based on a one&ndash;way function that pits the difficulty of solving the *discrete logarithm problem* (or *DLP*) in large&ndash;order [multiplicative integer groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group) against the ease of multiplying integers in such groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol is demonstrated in the sections that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Source Code\n",
    "The following sequence of function calls to the `dh` module (located in the [/src](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/code/src) directory of this repository) illustrates a session in which Alice encrypts a private message, and then transmits it to Bob over an insecure channel. Meanwhile, Eve&mdash;a passive adversary&mdash;intercepts the message transmitted on the insecure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the `dh` module; but that only Alice and Bob possess their own private keys, and also a shared encryption key each generates using their private keys as input. Eve, not having access to either Alice's or Bob's private keys, therefore cannot feasibly derive the session key Alice uses to encrypt the message she sends to Bob, thereby preventing Eve from learning the contents of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values below surrounded in square brackets [ ] are public (i.e., they can be transmitted over the insecure channel with no compromise to the security of the system, even if they are observed by Eve), and those that are not in square brackets are private (i.e., they must not be transmitted over the insecure channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanations of behavior appear below the code snippets and their outputs."
