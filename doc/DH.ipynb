    "# A Demonstration of the Diffie&ndash;Hellman Key Agreement Protocol\n",
    "Below I illustrate a protocol that permits two parties (Alice and Bob) to exchange a confidential message on an insecure channel, and which prevents a third party (Eve) who intercepts the message from learning its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first introduced this protocol in their seminal 1976 paper [*New Directions in Cryptography*](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). This protocol solved a problem that had afflicted all previously known ciphers; that of exchanging secret encryption keys *securely* between trusted parties as a prerequisite to private communication. The so&ndash;called *Diffie&ndash;Hellman key agreement protocol* remains to this day the de facto method for exchanging encryption keys on insecure channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same paper, Diffie and Hellman further imagined a novel cryptosystem in which a publicly&ndash;known key could be used to encrypt a message that only the owner of a different, *secret* key could decrypt. Such a method&mdash;what they termed a *public&ndash;key* cryptosystem&mdash;could further be employed to guarantee the authenticity of a message (a property that encryption alone could not provide), via a process they called *digital signature*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Diffie and Hellman failed to realize a practical implementation for such a public&ndash;key cryptosystem, they did succeed in laying the essential groundwork for it (it would fall to Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adlemen to flesh it out in their 1978 paper [*A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public&ndash;Key Cryptosystems*](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)). However, Diffie and Hellman did leave us with a practical implementation for secure key&ndash;exchange; one that remains to this day the de facto method for exchanging single (or *symmetric*) keys over insecure channels. The method is based on a [one&ndash;way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function) that pits the difficulty of solving the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (or DLP) in large&ndash;order [multiplicative integer groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group) against the ease of multiplication in such groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Source Code\n",
    "The following sequence of function calls to the [dh](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/dh.py) module illustrates a session in which Alice encrypts and transmits a  message to Bob over an insecure channel, which Bob successfully decrypts upon receipt. Meanwhile, an adversary (Eve) intercepts the message but, because the message is encrypted, has no feasible way of learning its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the [dh](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/dh.py) module; but that Alice and Bob keep the keys generated by this module secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of each code snippet is a line&ndash;comment to indicate who (i.e., Alice, Bob and/or Eve) is invoking the code. Illustrative code snippets, i.e., those that are not part of the protocol, but rather merely informative, are not commented."
