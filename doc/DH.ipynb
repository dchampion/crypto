    "# A Demonstration of the Diffie&ndash;Hellman Key Agreement Protocol\n",
    "The Diffie&ndash;Hellman protocol illustrated below permits two parties (Alice and Bob) to exchange a confidential message on an insecure channel, and prevents a third party (Eve) who intercepts the message from learning its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first introduced this protocol in their seminal 1976 paper [_New Directions in Cryptography_](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). This protocol solved a problem that had afflicted all previously known ciphers; that of exchanging secret encryption keys _securely_ between trusted parties. The so&ndash;called _Diffie&ndash;Hellman key agreement protocol_ remains to this day the de facto standard for negotiating shared keys over insecure channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same paper, Diffie and Hellman imagined a novel cryptosystem in which a publicly&ndash;known key could be used to encrypt a message that only the owner of a different, _secret_ key could decrypt. Such a system&mdash;what they termed a _public&ndash;key_ cryptosystem&mdash;could further be employed to guarantee the authenticity of a message (a property that encryption alone could not provide), via a method they called _digital signature_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Diffie and Hellman failed to realize a practical implementation for such a public&ndash;key cryptosystem, they did succeed in laying the essential groundwork for it (it would fall to Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adlemen to flesh it out in their 1978 paper [_A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public&ndash;Key Cryptosystems_](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Diffie and Hellman did leave us with a practical implementation for secure key&ndash;exchange. The method is based on a [one&ndash;way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function) that pits the difficulty of solving the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (or DLP) in large&ndash;order [multiplicative integer groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group) against the ease of multiplication in such groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Caveat\n",
    "Note that the procedure as demonstrated provides no guarantee as to the authenticity of either party; that is, that the participants Alice or Bob (or both) are who they claim to be (see [_man&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;middle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attack for elaboration). Nor does it guarantee that the message encrypted in the procedure cannot be decrypted by an adversary if either private key used in the procedure is leaked at a future date (see [_forward secrecy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) for elaboration). Protections against either vulnerability are not precluded by this implementation, but they are omitted here to minimize conceptual clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Procedure\n",
    "The following procedure, which utilizes the services of this repository's [dh](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/dh.py) module, illustrates a session in which Alice encrypts and transmits a  message to Bob over an insecure channel, which Bob successfully decrypts upon receipt. Meanwhile, an adversary (Eve) intercepts the message but, because the message is encrypted, has no feasible way of learning its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the [dh](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/dh.py) module; but that Alice and Bob keep the encryption keys generated by this module secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob start by importing the [dh](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/dh.py) module, and a module [sym](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/tests/core/sym.py) that implements a symmetric cipher they have agreed in advance will be used to encrypt and decrypt messages (the [sym](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/tests/core/sym.py) cipher used here is for illustrative purposes only, and in a real&ndash;world setting would be replaced with a cryptographically&ndash;strong symmetric cipher such as _3DES_ or _AES_)."

Because of this, it is more accurate to describe DH as a key _agreement_ protocol rather than a key _exchange_ protocol.\n",
