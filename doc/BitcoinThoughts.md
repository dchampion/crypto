# Cryptomania
[Neel Kashkari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari), the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said recently, "Cryptocurrencies are ninety&ndash;five percent fraud, hype, noise and confusion." As a cryptocurrency enthusiast, and an observer of the space since 2017, I think Kashkari has it wrong. I think the number is closer to ninety&ndash;nine percent.

# Blockchain
Take [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), for example; the most hyped buzzword in the crypto lexicon. Blockchain was invented (or, more precisely, cobbled together from a bunch of existing inventions) for a very specific use case&mdash;[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). It has since become the transaction&ndash;ledger implementation of choice for thousands of copycat cryptocurrencies (known as [_altcoins_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Altcoins)).

Yet blockchain is being touted by experts&mdash;hailing primarily from the finance industry&mdash;as the 21<sup>st</sup> century equivalent of the automobile, the airplane, the internet or _insert&ndash;civilization&ndash;changing&ndash;technology&ndash;here_. Forget about cryptocurrency, they say; focus instead on the great promise of the blockchain (as if _the_ blockchain were a single, canonical entity&mdash;it's not).

To me, this is a bit like somebody in the year 1900 saying that, twenty years from now, no one will remember the automobile; what they will remember is the internal combusion engine! Blockchain is the internal combustion engine on which cryptocurrency runs. Take away cryptocurrency, and that engine is not particularly useful.

What makes blockchain uniquely suited to cryptocurrency is the [_consensus mechanism_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp) that secures the blockchain as an incorruptible record of ownership. From the combination of blockchain _and_ its consensus mechanism emerges something greater than the sum of its parts. Without a compelling consensus mechanism&mdash;one that perfectly aligns the incentives of all stakeholders&mdash;blockchain is not a panacea, but instead just a really inefficient database.

# Altcoin
If the defining characteristic of blockchain is Kashkari's _hype_, then the explosion of altcoins takes the prize for _fraud, noise and confusion_. An altcoin is any one of hundreds of thousands&mdash;yes, _hundreds of thousands_!&mdash;of cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. Why is Bitcoin _not_ in this category, and all the others are? Because Bitcoin was the _first_ cryptocurrency; all others that followed&mdash;the altcoins&mdash;are copycats.

_Ether_, the coin native to the [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) blockchain, is perhaps the best&ndash;known of the copycat cryptocurrencies, and arguably the most reputable. Unlike Bitcoin, however, whose purpose is purely as an alternative to traditional (namely [fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money)) currency, Ether is not strictly speaking a cryptocurrency. Rather, it is a remunerative token (i.e., a unit of value), designed to compensate participants in an ecosystem with goals much different from, and much broader than, those of Bitcoin ([_decentralized finance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) being the latest incarnation).

It is for this reason that Ether should have any value at all; and not, like Bitcoin, purely as an alternative to traditional currency. Of course, this distinction has not deterred speculators from conflating the two, and gobbling up Bitcoin _and_ Ether (and many others) in hopes of getting rich quick.

The foregoing defense of Ether notwithstanding, the vast majority of altcoins (like 99.999%) are indeed, as Kashkari put it, the stuff of fraud, noise and confusion. Savvy crypto observers have coined (see what I did there?) a fitting term for them: [_shitcoins_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp).

# Shitcoin
The vast majority of shitcoins owe their existence to a shady practice known as an [_initial coin offering_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp), or ICO (a variation of initial _public_ offering, or IPO; a term borrowed from the world of finance, presumably to lend credibility to this less reputable variety).

An ICO works something like this: Someone with nothing better to do conjures up a silly name, the more meme&ndash;worthy the better, and sticks the word "coin" on the end of it (examples include _SEC_ coin, _Elon_ coin, _StopElon_ Coin, _Panda_ coin, _Shib_ coin, _Cat_ coin and the semi&ndash;profane _ASS_ coin). Then, using a user&ndash;friendly and publicly available [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), the shitcoin peddler sets it loose on an existing blockchain, say Ethereum (because building your own blockchain is a lot of work). Next, he convinces as many of his social&ndash;media followers as possible that the price of his coin will go parabolic so, _buy while you still can_! Of course, this is precisely what an astounding number of financial geniuses do, indeed causing the price of the coin to rise to atmospheric heights. At just the right moment, the shitcoin huckster&mdash;and likeky a small cabal of his co&ndash;conspirators&mdash;dumps his holdings and reaps a massive profit, leaving the suckers penniless.

Sound ridiculous? It should, and it is. Yet this pattern&mdash;or some variation of it&mdash;has played out hundreds, if not thousands, of times in recent years. _Dogecoin_&mdash;an altcoin named after a Shiba Inu cartoon dog meme&mdash;was literally created to satirize this ridiculous state of affairs. Yet so taken with Dogecoin were thousands of smart&ndash;money investors, its market capitalization surpassed $85 billion in May 2021! (Can you say StopElon coin?) Seems the adage _there's a sucker born every minute_ is a massive understatement.

# Bitcoin
If ninety&ndash;nine percent of cryptocurrency is hype, fraud, noise and confusion, then by definition there is one percent that is not. That one percent is Bitcoin. Bitcoin was around long before cryptocurrency spilled over into the popular culture, metastasizing into altcoins, ICOs, [non&ndash;fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) and god&ndash;knows&ndash;what next. And Bitcoin will be around long after the hype has subsided.

Here are few reasons why Bitcoin is legit&mdash;a star among pretenders:

___Bitcoin is durable.___ When I say Bitcoin will be around long after the crypto hype has subsisded, it is because Bitcoin's durability is synonymous with that of the internet. Any entity&mdash;say, a government&mdash;that would "shut down", or otherwise ban, Bitcoin, has as much chance of succeeding as it would shutting down or banning the weather&mdash;it's simply not possible.

___Bitcoin is simple.___ Bitcoin is a pure cryptocurrency, no more and no less. It doesn't pretend to be anything else, nor does its protocol allow it to be. Moreover, the simplicity of its design makes it resistant to hacking or theft (because the simpler the system, the fewer the avenues of attack).

High&ndash;profile [hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_and_crime#Exchanges)&mdash;which hold Bitcoin in custodial wallets, much like traditional banks hold USD in depositor accounts&mdash;should not be confused with hacks of Bitcoin itself. This is a widely&ndash;held fallacy. Bitcoin itself&mdash;the blockchain, the protocol, the infrastructure&mdash;has _never_ been hacked.

A system whose value routinely exceeds $1 trillion makes a juicy target for theives, yet Bitcoin has withstood any such attempts since 2009.

___Bitcoin is scarce.___ The Bitcoin protocol imposes an upper limit on the number of bitcoin that can ever be minted, or [_mined_](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/) (that limit is twenty&ndash;one million bitcoin). This makes Bitcoin a _deflationary_ asset, meaning that its value cannot be debased by arbitary or indiscriminate expansion (i.e., money printing).

This is not the case with fiat currencies like USD, or even the majority of altcoins. Consider for a moment that [eighty percent of every dollar](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL) that ever existed was printed in the calenar year 2020! If that statistic doesn't shock the conscience, none will.

___Bitcoin is frictionless.___ Many argue that Bitcoin lacks _intrinsic_ value. The simple counterpoint to that argument is to ask the question, what is the intrinsic value of a 20&ndash;dollar bill, or an ounce of gold? If the answer to the first question is, the full faith and credit of the United States government, then consult the previous paragraph.

The better answer would be that Bitcoin's intrinsic value is its ability to be transferred to anyone on the planet instantly, and without the institutional red tape and exorbitant fees characteristic of sovereign currency transfers.

___Bitcoin is a hedge.___ Anyone who believes the US dollar will serve in perpetuity as the world's reserve currency, forever holding its value relative to other sovereign currencies, need only look at the the history of the Spanish dollar, the British pound or the Dutch guilder. In the year 2019, how many people would have believed you if you told them a pandemic deadlier than the Spanish flu would soon sweep the globe? Very few.

Human beings are remarkably poor intuitive statisticians; it is hard for us believe as possible anything that has not already occurred in our lifetime. Loss of USD hegemony is no exception.

I am a believer in Bitcoin; what some might refer to as a _Bitcoin maximalist_ (less some of the more ideological, anarcho&ndash;libertarian aspects). I worry that Bitcoin's reputation will be sullied by the ninety&ndash;nine percent of cryptocurrency that _is_ hype, fraud, noise and confusion. Such a fate would be undeserved and undignified for what is one of the most ingenious inventions of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

I am not betting on this, by the way; I am long Bitcoin. And even if I am wrong, and my position plummets, my Bitcoin will always be my Bitcoin (_except I suppose, like fiat currency, you can't take it with you when you die_).
