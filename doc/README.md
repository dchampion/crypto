## What's in This Folder?
[**BitcoinThoughts.md**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/BitcoinThoughts.md) &ndash; Thoughts on the crypto craze, and a defense of Bitcoin.

[**DH.ipynb**](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/DH.ipynb) &ndash; A [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) notebook demonstrating the features of this repository's [dh module](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/src/dh.py), which implements the classic Diffie&ndash;Hellman key exchange protocol.

[**EC.ipynb**](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EC.ipynb) &ndash; A [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) notebook demonstrating the features of this repository's [ec module](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/src/ec.py), which contains an Elliptic&ndash;Curve implementation of the Diffie&ndash;Hellman key exchange protocol (ECDH), and the Elliptic Curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA).

[**EllipticCurves.ipynb**](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EllipticCurves.ipynb) &ndash; A [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) notebook demonstrating the properties of elliptic curves over the real numbers, which facilitates understanding their cryptographic brethren over finite fields.

[**EuclideanAlgorithms.md**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EuclideanAlgorithms.md) &ndash; A demonstration of the Euclidean algorithms, which are used extensively in public&ndash;key implementations to perform efficient division in finite multiplicative groups.

[**NumberTheory.md**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/NumberTheory.md) &ndash; Helpful mnemonics on the number&ndash;theoretic underpinnings of public&ndash;key cryptography.
