This folder contains notes and research on the subject of public&ndash;key cryptography.

Each artifact in this folder&mdash;excluding *meta* files like this README&mdash;is summarized below.

## List of Substantive Artifacts (alphabetical)
1. [**BitcoinThoughts.md**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/BitcoinThoughts.md) &ndash; Thoughts on the crypto craze, and a defense of Bitcoin.

2. [**CryptoNotes.txt**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/CryptoNotes.txt) &ndash; A collection of sundry notes gathered during the course of my research.

3. **Cryptography.xlsx** &ndash; A collection of *MS&ndash;Excel* worksheets used to facilitate my understanding of various cryptographic techniques.

4. [**dh.ipynb**](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/dh.ipynb) &ndash; A [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) notebook demonstrating the features of this repository's [dh module](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/src/dh.py), which implements the classic Diffie&ndash;Hellman key exchange protocol.

5. [**ec.ipynb**](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/ec.ipynb) &ndash; A [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) notebook demonstrating the features of this repository's [ec module](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/src/ec.py), which contains an Elliptic&ndash;Curve implementation of the Diffie&ndash;Hellman key exchange protocol (ECDH), and the Elliptic Curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA).

6. [**EuclideanAlgorithms.md**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EuclideanAlgorithms.md) &ndash; A demonstration of the Euclidean algorithms, which are used extensively in public&ndash;key implementations to perform efficient division in finite multiplicative groups.

7. [**LectureNotes.txt**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/LectureNotes.txt) &ndash; Lecture notes from a two&ndash;semester course on cryptography I took online in the winter and spring of 2020/2021.

8. [**NumberTheory.md**](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/NumberTheory.md) &ndash; Helpful mnemonics on the number&ndash;theoretic underpinnings of public&ndash;key cryptography.

9. [**TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/doc/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf) &ndash; A survey of public&ndash;key cryptography; a relatively modern branch of the field that is (among other things) foundational to internet security.

10. [**rsa.ipynb**](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/rsa.ipynb) &ndash; A [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) notebook demonstrating the features of this repository's [rsa module](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/src/rsa.py), which implements RSA primitives for secure key exchange, encryption and digital signature/verification.
