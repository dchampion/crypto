# Summary
This folder contains notes and research on the subject of cryptography, a high-level summary of which is presented in this ~12k-word <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/doc/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf>survey of <i>public-key</i> cryptography</a>; a relatively modern branch of the field that is (among other things) foundational to internet security.
<p>
If the mere thought of <i>12k-word survey</i> makes your eyes glaze over, read only the first page, which recounts a little-known and entertaining anecdote from the early days of academic cryptography.
<p>
Each artifact in this folder&mdash;excluding <i>meta</i> files like this README&mdash;is summarized below.

# List of Substantive Artifacts (alphabetical)
