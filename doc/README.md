## Summary
This folder contains explanations of various topics in public&ndash;key cryptography, ranging from the very basic to the very advanced. If you are new to the field, and want to learn the basics, start with [*The Elements Of Public Key Cryptography*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/doc/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf), which provides a history and very general survey of the field.

In this paper you will be introduced to mathematical concepts that may not be familiar; namely concepts in *number theory*, a basic understanding of which will make public&ndash;key cryptography much easier to understand. For a deeper dive into the math, have a look at [*Number Theory*](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/NumberTheory.md), which contains a list of helpful mnemonics on the number&ndash;theoretic underpinnings of public&ndash;key cryptography. Then look at [*Euclidean Algorithms*](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EuclideanAlgorithms.md), which contains step&ndash;by&ndash;step demonstrations of two ancient algorithms that are used extensively in public&ndash;key cryptosystems. Finally, for a treatment of the mathematical underpinnings of wild world of *Elliptic Curve Cryptography*, have a look at [*Elliptic Curves*](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EllipticCurves.ipynb). This document demonstrates the properties of elliptic curves over the real numbers, which thereby facilitates an understanding their cryptographic brethren over finite fields.

If you are a programmer, and want to see programmatic expressions of these concepts in source code, consult [*DH*](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/DH.ipynb) (Diffie&ndash;Hellman), [*RSA*](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/RSA.ipynb)  (Rivest&ndash;Shamir&ndash;Adleman) and [*EC*](https://nbviewer.org/github/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EC.ipynb) (Elliptic&ndash;Curve), which demonstrate programmatic usage of essential cryptographic services such as key agreement, encryption and digital signature.

Finally, for thoughts on the crypto craze, and a defense of Bitcoin, have a look at [*Bitcoin Thoughts*](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/BitcoinThoughts.md).
