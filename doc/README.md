## Summary

This folder contains explorations of various topics in public&ndash;key cryptography, ranging from the very basic to the very advanced. If you are new to the field, and want to learn the basics, start with [_The Elements Of Public Key Cryptography_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchampion/crypto/master/doc/TheElementsOfPublicKeyCryptography.pdf), which provides a history and very general survey of the field. In this paper you will be introduced (gently) to mathematical concepts that may not be familiar; namely concepts in _number theory_, a basic understanding of which will make public&ndash;key cryptography much easier to understand.

For a deeper dive into the math, have a look at [_Number Theory_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/NumberTheory.md), which contains a list of helpful mnemonics on the number&ndash;theoretic underpinnings of public&ndash;key cryptography. [_Euclidean Algorithms_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EuclideanAlgorithms.md) contains detailed demonstrations of two ancient algorithms, based on number theory, that are used extensively in public&ndash;key cryptosystems.

For a treatment of the mathematical underpinnings of the wild world of _Elliptic Curve Cryptography_, have a look at [_Elliptic Curves_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EllipticCurves.ipynb). This document demonstrates the properties of elliptic curves over the real numbers, which facilitates an understanding their cryptographic brethren over finite fields.

If you are a programmer, and want to see programmatic expressions of these concepts in source code, consult [_DH_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/DH.ipynb) (Diffie&ndash;Hellman), [_RSA_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/RSA.ipynb) (Rivest&ndash;Shamir&ndash;Adleman) and [_EC_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/EC.ipynb) (Elliptic&ndash;Curve), which demonstrate programmatic usage of essential cryptographic services such as key agreement, encryption and digital signature.

Finally, for thoughts on the crypto craze, and a defense of Bitcoin, have a look at [_Bitcoin Thoughts_](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/doc/BitcoinThoughts.md).
