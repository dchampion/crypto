    "# A Demonstration of the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The Diffie-Hellman protocol presented below simulates a confidential message exchange between two parties (Alice and Bob) over an insecure channel. Further, a third party (Eve), who intercepts the message encrypted using this protocol on the insecure channel, has no feasible way of learning its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie and Hellman first introduced this protocol in 1976, in their seminal paper [*New Directions in Cryptography*](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf). In it, the authors proposed a novel cryptosystem in which a publicly-known key could be used to encrypt a message that only the holder of a private key could decrypt, thereby solving the age-old problem of secure key-exchange in cryptographic schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is based on a one-way function that pits the difficulty of solving the *discrete logarithm problem* (or *DLP*) in large-order multiplicative integer groups against the ease of exponentiation (aka repeated multiplication) of integers in such groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sequence of function calls to the `dh` module (located in the [/src](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/code/src) directory of this repository) illustrates a session in which Alice encrypts a private message, and then transmits it to Bob over an insecure channel. Meanwhile, Eve&mdash;a passive adversary&mdash;intercepts the message transmitted on the insecure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the `dh` module; but that only Alice and Bob possess their own private keys, and also a shared encryption key each generates using their private keys as input. Eve, not having access to either Alice's or Bob's private keys, therefore cannot feasibly derive the session key Alice uses to encrypt the message she sends to Bob, thereby preventing Eve from learning the contents of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values below surrounded in square brackets [ ] are public (i.e., they can be transmitted over the insecure channel with no compromise to the security of the system, even if they are observed by Eve), and those that are not in square brackets are private (i.e., they must not be transmitted over the insecure channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Textual descriptions of behavior appear below the code snippets and their outputs."
