    "### A Brief History\n",
    "The field of elliptic&ndash;curve mathematics predates its applications in public&ndash;key cryptography by some 1,800 years. But in 1985, mathematician Neal Koblitz (and, independently, Victor S. Miller) dragged it from the depths of theoretical obscurity into the practical realm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a paper titled [_Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems_](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1987-48-177/S0025-5718-1987-0866109-5/S0025-5718-1987-0866109-5.pdf), Koblitz suggested that elliptic curves over finite fields were analogous&mdash;and perhaps even superior&mdash;to existing, practical implementations of public&ndash;key cryptography; in particular, those based on the multiplicative groups conceived by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in their seminal 1976 paper [_New Directions in Cryptography_](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf), and later cleverly adapted to schemes such as public&ndash;key encryption and digital signature by [Taher Elgamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taher_Elgamal).\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficacy of Diffie&ndash;Hellman style key agreement protocols relied on the difficulty of solving a one&ndash;way function known as the _discrete logarithm problem_, or _DLP_. With the contributions of Koblitz and Miller, elliptic&ndash;curve implementations of the DLP (known as _ECDLP_) have largely overtaken their multiplicative&ndash;group brethren due to their superior performance and security characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Elliptic Curve Over the Real Numbers\n",
    "They say a picture is worth a thousand words. So it is very helpful to see what at an ellipctic curve actually looks like before discussing its use in cryptography. Using Python, we can plot such a curve over the real numbers."

    "The code that renders the addition of $P$ and $Q$ graphically in _Figure 3_ uses the complicated&ndash;looking `add()` function to do the work of summing the points. Let's take a look at each line of code in that function to see what is going on.\n",

    "The slope is assigned to the variable $m$, because we will need this value in subsequent computations.\n",

    "Recall from above that the equation for an elliptic curve is $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$. And recall from high school algebra that the equation for a straight line is $y = mx + B$, where $m$ is the slope of the line, and $B$ is the $y$&ndash;coordinate of the point at which the line intercepts the $y$ axis. Thus we can rewrite the curve equation as follows, substituting $mx + B$ for $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(mx + B)^2 = x^3 + ax + b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Having reduced the curve equation to a _univariate_ (i.e., single variable) equation, we can manipulate it algebraically into the following form, which we call a _cubic_ polynomial equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x^3 - m^2x^2 + (a - 2mB)x + (b - B^2) = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Incidentally, a cubic polynomial in which the coefficient of the first term is $1$ is also known as a _monic_ polynomial.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the line between $P$ and $Q$ (almost always) intersects the curve at a third point $-R$, it has three distinct roots; that is, values of $x$ where the line intersects the curve at $P$, $Q$ and $-R$. Moreover, a property of cubic polynomials is that the sum of their roots is equal to the negative of the division of the coefficient of the second term by the coefficient of the first term. Algebraically:\n",

    "The discrete logarithm problem, as conceived by Diffie and Hellman, boils down to the difficulty of determining the value of an exponent given just its base, and the result of the exponent's application to this base. Algebraically, this translates to the question, given $x$ and $z$ in the equation $x^y = z$, what is the value of $y$? (Actually, in the realm of multiplicative groups, this should in fact be the congruence relation $x^y \\equiv z \\pmod p$; but, to keep things simple, we'll just say it's an equation.)\n",

It turns out this equation is very easy to compute in the _forward_ direction&mdash;that is, given $x$ and $y$, it is very easy to determine the value of $z$&mdash;but very hard to compute in the _reverse_ direction. This is why the DLP is referred to as a _one&ndash;way function_.\n",
    "\n",
    "With elliptic curves we can pose an analogous question: Given a point $Q$, how many times must you add the base point $P$ to itself to reach $Q$? Algebraically, this translates to the question, given $P$ and $Q$ in the equation $d \\times P = Q$, what is the value of $d$, where $d$ is the number of repeated additions of $P$? While it is very easy to compute $Q$ given $d$ and $P$, it turns out to be very difficult to compute $d$ given $P$ and $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a cryptographic scheme, $d$ can be thought of as the private key, and $Q$ the public key. And whereas it is very easy for a user (say, Alice) to generate an elliptic&ndash;curve key pair $d$ and $Q$, publish $Q$ widely, and participate in a secure key exchange with another user (say, Bob), it is very difficult for an eavesdropper (say, Eve) to recover $d$ from the public parameters $P$ and $Q$.\n",

    "The discerning reader may now wonder, why is it any more difficult for our adversary, Eve, to compute the private key $d$, given $P$ and $Q$, than it is for Alice to compute $Q$ given $d$ and $P$? After all, Alice must perform $d$ additions of $P$ to compute $Q$, which is exactly the same number of additions Eve must perform to find $Q$ (thereby revealing the value of the private key $d$ to Eve).\n",

    "### Double&ndash;and&ndash;Add\n",

If Alice is using a cryptographically secure curve, this means that $d$ will be an astronomically large number and, moreover, because it was generated by a CSPRNG, all but impossible for Eve to guess.\n",

    "Alice's advantage is that her advance knowledge of $d$ allows her to use a shortcut to compute $Q$ that Eve cannot use. She does this by scanning the binary representation of $d$, starting with the most significant bit; i.e., she scans the bits from left to right. The first bit she sees will always be `1`, and this represents the base point $P$. For every bit she encounters thereafter, whether it is a `0` or a `1`, she doubles the current point.

    "### Final Observations\n",
    "A few special properties of elliptic curves of prime order lend themselves to applications in cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that the values of $p$ and $n$, while both prime, are not the same (in the example above $p=23$ and $n=29$). This is because curve points are not integers, but rather $xy$ coordinate pairs, each member of which can have a value from $0$ to $p-1$. This means there are $p^2 + 1$ possible distinct $xy$ pairs. Therefore, unlike the traditional implementation of the discrete logarithm problem given by Diffie&ndash;Hellman, the group order $n$ does not necessarily equal the prime modulus $p$ (or, more precisely, $p-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, a very important [result from Hasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse%27s_theorem_on_elliptic_curves) tells us that, even if they are not equal, $p$ must nevertheless be very close to $n$. Specifically, $n$ must fall within the _Hasse bound_, which asserts the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|n-(p+1)| <= 2\\sqrt{p}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, this means that if the field parameter $p$ of an elliptic curve group is a very large number, so too is the group's order $n$. This is important, because when selecting a field parameter for an elliptic curve, cryptographers must know there are a sufficient number of points on the curve to make solving the discrete logarithm very hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, due to [Lagrange's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange's_theorem_%28group_theory%29), since the order $n$ of the curve is prime, its only subgroups are the subgroup of order $1$ and the subgroup of order $n$, which is the entire group. As a consequence, every single point on the curve (except an artificial point called _the point at infinity_, which serves as the group's identity element) will generate the entire group of size $n$. How do we know $n$ is prime? After all, Hasse only tells us the interval within which $n$ falls, not its precise value. This was made possible by [Schoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoof%27s_algorithm), who in 1985 devised a polynomial&ndash;time algorithm to count the number of points on a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these properties, cryptographers have the ingredients required to create cryptographically secure curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, elliptic curves over finite fields could not be more different from those over the real numbers. Algebraically, however, they behave almost exacly the same, and therefore provide a powerful implementation of a discrete logarithm problem suitable for use in cryptographic schemes."
