    "# A Demonstration of the RSA Cryptosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rivest&ndash;Shamir&ndash;Adleman ([RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\\(cryptosystem\\))) cryptosystem illustrated below combines secure key&ndash;exchange with digital signature to provide for the _confidentiality_, _integrity_ and _authenticity_ of a private message exchanged between two parties (Alice and Bob) over an insecure channel. Moreover, an adversary (Eve) listening on this channel has no practical way of learning the content of the message, nor any way of tampering with it without the receiving party knowing the message has been corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key&ndash;exchange component of this cryptosystem provides for message confidentiality utilizing a [_key&ndash;encapsulation mechanism_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_encapsulation_mechanism) (or _KEM_). This differs from more traditional approaches to key negotiation that utilize a key&ndash;_agreement_ mechanism, such as those based on the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) introduced by Diffie and Hellman in their seminal 1976 paper [_New Directions in Cryptography_](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital signature component of this cryptosystem provides for message integrity and authenticity, ideas that were conceived by Diffie and Hellman in their 1976 paper, but not realized until Rivest, Shamir and Adleman published [_A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public&ndash;Key Cryptosystems_](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf) in 1978.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Caveat\n",
    "Note that the procedure as demonstrated provides no guarantee as to the authenticity of either party; that is, that the participants Alice or Bob (or both) are who they claim to be (see [_man&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;middle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attack for elaboration). Nor does it guarantee that the shared key encrypted in the procedure cannot be decrypted by an adversary if the private key used to decrypt it is compromised at a future date (see [_forward secrecy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) for elaboration). Protections against either vulnerability are not precluded by this implementation, but they are omitted here to minimize conceptual clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Procedure\n",
    "The following procedure, which utilizes the services of this repository's [rsa](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/rsa.py) module, illustrates a session in which Alice signs and encrypts a private message, and then transmits the message to Bob over an insecure channel. Meanwhile, an adversary (Eve) intercepts the message, but cannot feasibly learn its content, nor tamper with it without Bob detecting the message has been corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that Alice, Bob and Eve all possess their own copy of the [rsa](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/rsa.py) module; but that only Alice and Bob possess the signing and decryption keys produced by this module to provide the aforementioned protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob start by importing the [rsa](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/core/rsa.py) module, and a module [sym](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/tests/core/sym.py) that implements a symmetric cipher they have agreed in advance will be used to encrypt and decrypt messages (the [sym](https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/src/tests/core/sym.py) cipher used here is for illustrative purposes only, and in a real&ndash;world setting would be replaced with a cryptographically&ndash;strong symmetric cipher such as _3DES_ or _AES_)."
