# Summary
The modules in this package implement many of the public-key primitives one might expect to find in a cryptography library, such as key generation, encryption, decryption, digital signature and signature verification; they do not implement higher-level services (e.g. interoperability protocols, authentication) which, in addition to the primitives just mentioned, would be provided in a fully-featured cryptography library.

As such, while this library may be of academic interest to someone studying public-key cryptography, it should probably not be used to secure sensitive data in real applications.

The source code, which is located in the <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/code/src>/src</a> folder of this repository, is well documented, both in <i>docstrings</i> at the module and function level, which describe at a high level the behavior of the module or function; and inline comments embedded in the function implementations, which are intended to clarify the effect of a particular statement or group of statements immediately following the comment.

Unit tests, which are located in the <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/tree/master/code/test>/test</a> folder of this repository, are also documented. The most useful of this documentation is embedded in the full-protocol tests inside <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/test/dh_test.py>dh_test.py</a> and <a href=https://github.com/dchampion/crypto/blob/master/code/test/rsa_test.py>rsa_test.py</a>. The full-protocol tests walk the reader from start to finish through a simulated session, from parameter-setup and key-negotiation to secure message-exchange.
